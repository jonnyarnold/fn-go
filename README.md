Fn is a prototype functional programming language with the following aims:

- Teach me about functional programming and language design.
- (Optional) Be a useful minimalist functional programming language.

## How does it look?

Check out [the tour](tour.fn).

## How do I use it?

Please don't. I don't know what I'm doing. If you use it and like, it let me know; if you don't like it, don't contact me. Thanks :)
